## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
   ```
   * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
     you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
   go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
search for **`FileDiffs`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Install keymaps for the commands (see Example.sublime-keymap for my preferred keys)

### Sublime Text 2

1. Open the Sublime Text 2 Packages folder
2. Clone this repo, but use the `st2` branch

    ```
    # Over SSH
    git clone -b st2 git@github.com:colinta/SublimeFileDiffs

    # Over HTTPS
    git clone -b st2 https://github.com/colinta/SublimeFileDiffs.git
    ```

Add External Diff Tool *(optional)*
--------

(IMPORTANT: You might need to make a symlink (e.g. in /usr/local/bin) pointing to the command line tool of your external diff tool)

1. Preferences > Package Settings > FileDiffs > Settings - Default

2. Uncomment one of the examples or write your own command to open external diff tool.

   This command *may* need to be a full path (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/ksdiff`), if the command isn't in your `PATH`.

It supports:

-   A generic setting `FileDiffs.sublime-settings` which could be overloaded for each parameter in a platform specific configuration `FileDiffs ($platform).sublime-settings` in the `Settings - User`
-   Environment variable expansions for `cmd` parameter in the settings


Commands
--------

`file_diff_menu`: Shows a menu to select one of the file_diff commands.  If you use the bindings in Example.sublime-keymap, this is bound to `ctrl+shift+d`.

The rest of the commands do not need to be bound (accessible from the menu):

`file_diff_clipboard`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and the clipboard (the clipboard is considered the "new" file unless `reverse` is True)

`file_diff_selections`: Shows the diff of the first and second selected regions.  The file_diff_menu command checks for exactly two regions selected, otherwise it doesn't display this command.

`file_diff_saved`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and the saved file.

`file_diff_file`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and a file that is in the current project.

`file_diff_tab`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and an open file (aka a file that has a tab).

`file_diff_previous`: Shows the diff of the current file or selection(s) and the previous activated file.
